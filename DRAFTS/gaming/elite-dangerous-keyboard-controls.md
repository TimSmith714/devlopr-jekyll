# Elite Dangerous Keybo

This was an interesting idea. I'd started playing Elite Dangerous with a joystick (the rather good Saitek Avi8or) and have stuck with it for the rare times I'm looking for combat but as I mostly fly exploration these days, I've gone over to mouse and keyboard.

I was rather sceptical of this but in practice I've found it really good. It did occur to me as I arrived at Colonia that trying out a new keyboard control system on landing for the first time might be a bad idea after 700-odd jumps but it worked just fine.

This inspired me to have a look for making my own keyboard layouts. Find out more here
