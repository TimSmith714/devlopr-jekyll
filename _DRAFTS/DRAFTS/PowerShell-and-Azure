# Powershell with azure

Realised that I was using Bash in the Azure Cloud Shell in Windows Terminal. So I thought I would follow the instructions to use PowerShell instead, this involves upgrading Powershell to verison 7. Leaping 2 versions ahead sounds like fun.

Downloaded latest version from GitHub via the link at
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows?view=powershell-7

Selected all the options. 

Now got another option in the new tab options in Windows Terminal 

Now install Azure PowerShell
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-4.3.0
Beware the pause after entering the command to load the cmdlet through PowerShell
Again there'll be a pause and then some messages will appear at the top in blue as the cmdlets are installed

The command prompt should reappear 
Restart PowerShell
