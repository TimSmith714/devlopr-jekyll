Sometimes it's hard to be a developer on Windows and you cast an envious eye over to the Unix world. Some of the CLI tools are so attractive. Don't get me wrong, PowerShell constantly impresses me but I'm envious of those times when installing a new framework can be done with a single ```apt install```.

So over the years I've sneaked in Virtual Machines (when my PC could handle it) or reused old PCs that were lying around but remote access is never quite the same. Especially if, like me, you appreciate the extra help from Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code. I'm not saying vim isn't powerful, but there's only so many text editors I can learn.

Enter WSL and the way it works with Visual Studio Code. I'm writing this in Visual Studio Code on Windows connected to the Ubuntu WSl on the same computer. I can work on the Jekyll site in the terminal (and Windows Terminal is wonderful for this) but use a friendlier editor on my desktop.
